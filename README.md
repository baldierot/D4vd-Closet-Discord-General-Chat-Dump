You can use the search bar to search for message texts or authors, or press ```Ctrl + F``` (Windows) or ```Command + F``` (Mac) to use your browser's "Find" function to search for specific words and mentions on the page.

Warning: The performance when viewing the dump is not great due to the sheer amount of messages and suboptimal coding. Do not load too many parts at once as it will slow down your device considerably. A powerful device is recommended.

Notice: This is a dump that includes raw text messages, but only link references to assets like profile pics, emojis, attached images, GIFs, videos, rather than the assets themselves. Therefore, those assets might become unavailable in the future once Discord stops hosting them. This is a text-only dump, sorry.
