You can use ```Ctrl + F``` or ```Command + F``` to use "Find" on the webpage and search for specific words and mentions.

Notice: This is a dump that includes raw text messages, but only link references to assets like profile pics, emojis, attached images, GIFs, videos, rather than the assets themselves. Therefore, those assets might become unavailable in the future once Discord stops hosting them.
